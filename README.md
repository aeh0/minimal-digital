# About

**Minimal Digital** is an introductory toolkit compiled as part of an [AHRC-RLUK Professional Practice Fellowship Scheme](https://www.rluk.ac.uk/ahrc-rluk-professional-practice-fellows-announced/) project to research, trial, and review free and simple tools for getting started with digital storytelling, digital archives, and digital humanities projects.

The tools reviewed on this site are all free to use, and based on [minimal computing](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/). No need for web hosting, servers, or databases. They can be used by anyone, anywhere, to support self-development, teaching, research, and creativity. The toolkit is intended to introduce these tools in an accessible, jargon-free way. Many are underpinned by a technical framework known as [IIIF](https://aeh0.github.io/minimal-digital/iiif/).
