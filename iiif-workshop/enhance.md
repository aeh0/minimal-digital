# Enhance

Another advantage IIIF offers is the ease with which images can be manipulated by the viewer within the browser, without altering the original file.&#x20;

Here's an example of a letter written by the poet Edward Thomas, during his service as a First World War soldier. The letter is written in pencil on thin, poor quality paper.

The Internet Archive offers controls for visual adjustment. In the left hand menu, you can zoom, switch the polarity, and adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation on the fly, without the need to edit the original.&#x20;

Altering these settings has various useful applications for bringing out details that might be hard to see in the original. It can be particularly valuable when trying to read faint handwriting on a manuscript, or decipher information that has been crossed out, representing a significant enhancement of the original document.
