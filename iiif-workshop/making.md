# Create

IIIF is not just for major organisations. As of 2023, anyone can create IIIF-compatible images, for free, without access to an image serveer, by [uploading to the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/upload).&#x20;

Note the Internet Archive filename, found in the URL, e.g. [https://archive.org/details/](https://archive.org/details/)\[filename]. Add this to the following string to create a IIIF manifest: **https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/3/\[filename]/manifest.json**. The manifest can be pasted into any IIIF viewer or editing tool, for enhanced viewing and remixing.
