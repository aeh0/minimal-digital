This self-guided workshop will help you get started with the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF). It will give you the skills to locate and re-use millions of open access images of books, manuscripts, and art from some of the worldâ€™s greatest libraries, archives and museums. Learn how to find, compare, download, embed, and share IIIF images, and have a go at making your own virtual tours and guided viewing experiences.

No previous IIIF experience or expertise is required!
