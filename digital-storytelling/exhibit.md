# Exhibit

Exhibit was developed during the COVID-19 pandemic to assist library and academic staff tasked with delivering remote teaching with rare books and archives. It continues to be invaluable as a free digital tool for creating professional interactive presentations for audience engagement and education.

Unlike [Storiiies](storiiies.md), Exhibit does not support non-IIIF images. However, it supports the annotation of multiple views of multiple books, manuscripts, or objects, in 2D or 3D, from [any institution in the world that uses IIIF](https://iiif.io/guides/finding\_resources/) to deliver its [digital collections](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].

Both [Storiiies](storiiies.md) and Exhibit presentations can be used in isolation, or embedded in websites, some examples of which we'll look at in the next section.
