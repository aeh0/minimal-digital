# Exhibit

Exhibit was developed during the COVID-19 pandemic to assist library and academic staff tasked with delivering remote teaching with rare books and archives. It continues to be invaluable as a free digital tool for creating professional interactive presentations and quizzes for audience engagement and education.

Unlike [Storiiies](storiiies.md), Exhibit does not support non-IIIF images. However, it supports the annotation of multiple views of books, manuscripts, and objects, in 2D or 3D, from [any institution in the world that uses IIIF](https://iiif.io/guides/finding\_resources/) to deliver its digital collections.

Narrative presentation can be customised according to need:

* [Scroll](https://www.exhibit.so/docs/scroll-template) - move seamlessly through images from top to bottom using a mouse wheel
* [Slides](https://www.exhibit.so/docs/slides-template) - move left to right as a slideshow using a mouse click or arrow keys
* [Kiosk](https://www.exhibit.so/docs/kiosk-template) - play pre-timed images on a loop, requiring no user interaction
* [Quiz](https://www.exhibit.so/docs/quiz-template) - create interactive quizzes using multiple choice and pinpoints

Exhibit offers a simple user interface and a high degree of customisation. Users can create presentations from scratch, or modify a basic template. Presentations can either be public or password protected, making them suitable for submission by students as formal assessments.

### Set up



Both [Storiiies](storiiies.md) and Exhibit presentations can be used in isolation, or embedded in websites, some examples of which we'll look at in the next section.
