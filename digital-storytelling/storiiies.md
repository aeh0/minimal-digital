# Storiiies

Storiiies is the best place to get started with image annotation. You can use it with IIIF images, but they're not essential - you can use any large jpeg. It offers a free and simple interface which allows you to upload an image, zoom into details, and tag any area of interest with text. The final presentation will move through the annotations in order. Currently, you can only add one image to a single presentation (use [Exhibit](exhibit.md) if you need to add more). Storiiies supports detailed readings of a single image, for exhibition purposes, teaching, or as a learning exercise.

These guided viewings were made using Storiiies - Hans Holbein's painting, [The Ambassadors](https://storiiies.cogapp.com/viewer?manifest=https://storiiies.cogapp.com/holbein/manifest.json), and George Cruikshank's etching, [State Miners](https://sharc.kcl.ac.uk/exhibition/section-two-acting-royal/a-mad-king-king-lear/state-miners-1).

Start by loading the [Storiiies editor](https://storiiies-editor.cogapp.com/). This is web-based, and doesn't require users to sign in or download anything.
