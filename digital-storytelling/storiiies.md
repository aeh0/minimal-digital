# Storiiies

This guided viewing of [Hans Holbein's Ambassadors](https://storiiies.cogapp.com/viewer?manifest=https://storiiies.cogapp.com/holbein/manifest.json) was made using Storiiies.

Storiiies offers a simple interface for tagging images with annotations. You can use a IIIF image if you have one, but it will also load a standard JPEG, and convert it to IIIF for you. The issue with jpegs is needing a very large image, otherwise you can't zoom into enough detail to annotate successfully - do some testing with phone.
