# Reunify

IIIF is designed with interoperability in mind. The images of any institution using the framework will work in the same way as those of another. This means they can be pulled into a web-based viewer like [Mirador](https://mirador-dev.netlify.app/\_\_tests\_\_/integration/mirador/) to be compared and manipulated. Or with a little technical skill, code from two or more objects can be combined to create a new digital composite, reconstructing cultural heritage that may have become physically separated across different repositories.

This [demo](https://demos.biblissima.fr/chateauroux/demo/) shows the virtual reconstruction of a damaged manuscript from Châteauroux in France (Grandes Chroniques de France, ca. 1460).

At some point in the manuscript's history, its fourteen illuminations were cut out, and by the 19th century, eventually ended up at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. The digitisation of the [miniatures](https://gallica.bnf.fr/Search?idArk=\&n=50\&p=1\&lang=FR\&adva=1\&adv=1\&reset=\&urlReferer=%2Fadvancedsearch%3Flang%3DFR\&enreg=\&tri=\&catsel1=f\_source\&cat1=4-AD-133\&ope2=MUST\&catsel2=f\_creator\&cat2=\&ope3=MUST\&catsel3=f\_tdm\&cat3=\&date=daTo\&daFr=\&daTo=\&t\_typedoc=images\&sel\_collection=toutesCollections\&biblio=Biblioth%C3%A8que+nationale+de+France\&sel\_source=toutSources\&biblioSpecifique=Gallica\&sel\_provenance\_Part=toutPartenaires\&sel\_provenance\_Edist=toutSNE\&dateMiseEnLigne=indexDateFrom\&firstIndexationDateDebut=\&firstIndexationDateFin=\&tri=\&submit2=Lancer+la+recherche) by BNF, and the [full manuscript](https://bvmm.irht.cnrs.fr/consult/consult.php?reproductionId=4490) by Chateauroux Municipal Library, allows the virtual reconstruction of the manuscript in its original state, using IIIF. The layers can be toggled on or off, and the opacity adjusted, within the browser.
