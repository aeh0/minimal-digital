# Deep zoom

Tiled images can be zoomed into at astonishing levels of detail, quickly and responsively, even if the image is very large. The browser only loads the precise tiles that are needed, and this reduces the processing power needed to view the image.

Take a look at [Rembrandt's Night Watch](https://hyper-resolution.org/view.html?pointer=0.329,0.001\&i=Rijksmuseum/SK-C-5/SK-C-5\_VIS\_20-um\_2019-12-21), from the Rijksmuseum, the largest and most detailed photo ever taken of a work of art. What you are viewing is a digital composite, as [the original painting was photographed in high resolution 8,439 times](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/stories/operation-night-watch/story/ultra-high-resolution-image-of-the-night-watch). At 5.6TB, this is large enough to crash most browsers.&#x20;

By using IIIF to tile the object into digital fragments, viewers are able to zoom in, without lag, to see individual brushstrokes, hairline cracks, and particles of pigment.&#x20;

* Open the [Night Watch](https://hyper-resolution.org/view.html?pointer=0.329,0.001\&i=Rijksmuseum/SK-C-5/SK-C-5\_VIS\_20-um\_2019-12-21)
* Zoom in, and pan around - watch the address in the URL bar update as you move
* Try copying the address, and pasting it in a new tab - your location has been saved!
