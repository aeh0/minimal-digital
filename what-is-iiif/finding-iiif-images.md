# Finding IIIF images

Cultural heritage institutions that deliver freely licensed access to their digital collections using IIIF are listed on the [IIIF website](https://iiif.io/guides/finding\_resources/). The list includes major museums and galleries, state and national libraries, and research-led universities from around the world. In 2022, the number of cultural heritage items made available via IIIF was estimated at 1 billion.

Clicking on the link to each institution will lead you to a page that describes how to access that institution's digital collections, and how to find the **manifest** for a IIIF object.&#x20;

The manifest is a package that contains all the images belonging to a digital object, plus its metadata (e.g. the title, author, date information that explains what those images represent). The manifest is delivered in a URI that allows the object to be opened in any IIIF viewer or tool.

Manifests are what make IIIF images truly interoperable - reusable by anyone, anywhere - radically democratising access to the world's cultural heritage. For instance, the [digital storytelling](../digital-storytelling/) tools described in this toolkit allow books, archives, and artworks from any collection in the world to be annotated and enhanced with scholarly narratives.
