# What is IIIF?

If you work with digital representations of books, archives, or art, the [International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)](https://iiif.io/) might just be your new best friend. Adopted by major cultural heritage organisations around the world, the framework defines international standards for viewing and sharing digital images online in a consistent and interoperable way. It allows researchers to:&#x20;

* View images from different institutions side by side, with contextual metadata
* Actively engage with images - zoom in, pan around, add annotations
* Cite and share using consistent, stable image URLs

IIIF (pronounced triple-eye-eff) breaks down cultural heritage silos by allowing images from any library, archive, gallery, or museum that has adopted the framework to be digitally shared, reunited, analysed side-by-side, and examined in minute detail through a powerful zoom capability. Images can be freely annotated, enhanced, remixed, and repurposed, for any aspect of research or teaching.

[A more technical explanation of IIIF](https://iiif.io/) involves talk of servers and APIs, but you don't really need to know about those things. A simple analogy is that of a mosaic - each image is broken down into hundreds of smaller digital images, called tiles. Each tile has a unique URL that defines its location in relation to the others. The following pages describe the significance of tiled images for research.
