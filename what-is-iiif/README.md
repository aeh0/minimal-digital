# What is IIIF?

If you use digital representations of books, archives, or art in your research or teaching, the [International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)](https://iiif.io/) has the potential to transform the way you work. Adopted by over 100 major cultural heritage organisations around the world, the framework defines international standards for viewing and sharing digital images online in a consistent and interoperable way.&#x20;

IIIF (pronounced 'triple-eye-eff') breaks down cultural heritage silos, by allowing images from any library, archive, gallery, or museum that has adopted the framework to be:&#x20;

* [Examined](examine.md) in minute detail
* [Annotated](annotate.md) with text or other images
* Enhanced in-browser: adjusting brightness, contrast and polarity without altering the original file
* [Reunited](reunify.md) with related material from other institutions
* Compared side by side in one browser window
* Contextualised with metadata
* Shared responsibly with stable image URLs and attribution
* Repurposed endlessly in third party sites and tools

[A more technical explanation of IIIF](https://iiif.io/) involves talk of servers and APIs, but you don't really need to know about those things. A simple analogy is that of a mosaic - each image is broken down into hundreds of smaller digital images, called tiles. Each tile has a unique URI that defines its location in relation to the others. This is what powers one of IIIF's most popular features - deep zoom.
