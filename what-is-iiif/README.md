# What is IIIF?

One of the biggest issues faced by those who use digital representations of books, archives, or art in research or teaching, is the way that almost every library or museum presents their digitised material inconsistently. Different institutions use different viewers, varying in functionality and ease of use, and implement different rules about download and re-use. It's a confusing landscape for researchers to navigate.

The [International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)](https://iiif.io/), pronounced 'triple-eye-eff', addresses this issue. Essentially, it is a list of rules that institutions agree to adhere to. These rules determine a set way to present images and their descriptive data, ensuring that digital images can be viewed and shared online in a consistent and interoperable way, regardless of origin. Institutions that follow these rules are helping to break down digital silos, and unlock their collections for wider re-use. To date, IIIF has been adopted by [over 100 major cultural heritage organisations worldwide](https://iiif.io/guides/finding\_resources/).

IIIF offers a number of benefits. Images from libraries, archives, galleries, and museums that have adopted the framework can be:&#x20;

* [Examined](examine.md) in minute detail
* [Annotated](annotate.md) with text or other images
* [Enhanced](enhance.md) in-browser: adjusting brightness, contrast and polarity without altering the original file
* [Reunited](reunify.md) with related material from other institutions
* [Compared](compare-to-do.md) side by side in one browser window
* [Contextualised](contextualise.md) with metadata

...and repurposed endlessly in online tools and resources, to create [digital narratives](../digital-storytelling/), or [digital archives and exhibitions](../digital-archives-and-exhibitions/).

[A more technical explanation of IIIF](https://iiif.io/) involves talk of servers and APIs, but you don't really need to know about those things. A simple analogy is that of a mosaic - each image is broken down into hundreds of smaller digital images, called tiles. Each tile has a unique URI that defines its location in relation to the others. This is what powers one of IIIF's most popular features - deep zoom.
