# Contextualise

Metadata is built into the fabric of IIIF – a manifest bundles both images, and textual information to describe what those images represent. Every IIIF viewer features a panel that allows this information to be viewed alongside the image. A digital object will never be detached from its description, even if it’s viewed outside its home repository, such as in a workspace like Mirador, or in an online exhibition on another platform. It will always retain a connection to information that describes the image, where it’s comes from, and what you can and can’t do with the image in terms of licensing.

IIIF is designed for the responsible sharing of images, and it’s easy to see at a glance what terms and conditions may apply. IIIF images are never ‘lost’ online. Their metadata anchors them to the home repository, and to any re-use licence that may apply. This encourages cultural organisations and their partners to trust that digitisation will widen access to their collections in a managed and responsible way. Downloading, sharing, and embedding links are built into every IIIF viewer, using stable URLs appropriate for scholarly citations.

Metadata is used to describe the object as a whole, and individual images within it. This is particularly useful when examining [digitally reunited manuscripts](reunify.md), such as this [glossed bible](https://projectmirador.org/embed/?iiif-content=https://dms-data.stanford.edu/data/manifests/Stanford/ege1/manifest.json).&#x20;

Clicking on the hamburger icon (three horizontal lines) in the top left shows an Information panel containing contextual background about the circumstances of the bible's destruction and reconstruction. Below the Information button is a Rights, or attribution button, describing which organisations have contributed their images to the object, and below that is an Index, itemising each page and which library it belongs to.

Some organisations are working on embedding IIIF image viewers inside their archives catalogues. This would mean that not only would you see the item’s description when you look at an image, you would also be able to see, appreciate and understand the relationship of that item to its wider archival context.&#x20;

When looking at a letter from person A to person B, you might want to know: how many other letters were sent from A? Over what period? Are there replies from B? These are questions that an archive catalogue can answer, but which are difficult to ascertain when searching thousands of images gathered in a repository. This development work has the potential to transform the archives research experience, and work to close the gap between archive catalogues on the one hand, and digital repositories on the other.
