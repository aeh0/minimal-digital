# Annotations

The other advantage to being able to define and save a specific section of an image, is that we can attach information to it, enhancing the original. 'Annotation' can be as simple as connecting a plain text transcription to an image from a book, in order to make the words it contains searchable.&#x20;

Text search [https://wellcomelibrary.org/moh/report/b18250464#?c=0\&m=0\&s=0\&cv=46](https://wellcomelibrary.org/moh/report/b18250464#?c=0\&m=0\&s=0\&cv=46)

Or, an image can be annotated with another image, for example, overlaying a historic map on top of a modern version, to visualise spatial change over time.&#x20;

Overlaying: Compariscope. https://vanda.github.io/iiif-features/compariscope.html

Or, we can add curatorial commentary, to allow us to tell stories with images.&#x20;

The Rijksmuseum have used this capability to create [guided viewings of the Night Watch](https://beleefdenachtwacht.nl/en). This toolkit describes ways in which you can make your own narratives and tours of books, manuscripts, and images, using tools like [Storiiies](broken-reference) and [Exhibit](broken-reference).
