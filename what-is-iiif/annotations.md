# Annotations

The other advantage to being able to define and save a specific section of an image, is that we can attach information to it, enhancing the original. 'Annotation' can be as simple as connecting a plain text transcription to an image from a book, in order to make the words it contains searchable.

Or, an image can be annotated with another image, for example, overlaying a historic map on top of a modern version, to visualise spatial change over time.

Or, we can add curatorial commentary, to allow us to tell stories with images.

The Rijksmuseum have used this capability to create [guided viewings of the Night Watch](https://beleefdenachtwacht.nl/en). This toolkit describes ways in which you can make your own narratives and tours of books, manuscripts, and images, using tools like [Storiiies](broken-reference/) and [Exhibit](broken-reference/).
