# Annotate

Being able to define and save a specific section of an image using a URL means we can attach additional information to it, enhancing the original.

### Transcription

Annotation can be as simple as connecting a plain text transcription to images from a book, in order to make the words they contains searchable. Open this [Medical Officer's report](https://wellcomelibrary.org/moh/report/b18250464/0#?c=0\&m=0\&s=0\&cv=0\&z=-1.788%2C-0.1202%2C4.589%2C1.7914) from the Wellcome Collection. Without annotation, each word in this report would only be an image of a word, but by connecting a transcript using IIIF, the text can be accessed via a search function.&#x20;

Try searching for 'influenza' in the keyword search box - notice that as you type, other words contained in the work that start with 'inf...' are suggested. This is particularly useful if the spelling of the word you want to search for has changed over time, as is often the case in historical sources.

When you search for 'influenza', you'll find 9 results. When you click on one of the yellow markers, you'll be taken to a page on which that word can be found, with the precise location of the work digitally highlighted.

### Overlay

Some objects may be enhanced by overlaying another object on top, which can be viewed or hidden as needed. An historian may wish to overlay a 19th century map on top of a modern version, to visualise spatial change over time, while an art historian might want to overlay a preliminary sketch or underpainting with the finished result.

Take a look at these [Raphael cartoons](https://vanda.github.io/curtain-viewer/) from the Victoria and Albert Museum, which have been digitised using three different techniques, with the resulting images overlaid. Try clicking the 'infrared' toggle, then scroll over the painting. You can now see two layers - the painting's surface, and the original charcoal underdrawing, made visible using infrared photography. Clicking the 'surface' toggle adds a third layer - the 3D surface of the canvas. This allows us to see tiny pinpricks in the painting, created when the designs were transferred to fabric in order to be made into tapestries.

### Commentary

Annotations may take the form of curatorial commentary, allowing us to tell stories with images.

The Rijksmuseum used this capability to create [guided, multimedia tours of the Night Watch](https://beleefdenachtwacht.nl/en).

An interesting use of digital curatorial annotation beyond the cultural heritage sector, is this ambitious, richly annotated version of [The Garden of Earthly Delights](https://archief.ntr.nl/tuinderlusten/en.html) by Jheronimus Bosch. Created by NTR, a Dutch public service broadcaster, this annotation project describes itself as an 'interactive documentary'. Click on the flags to zoom in on the painting, and hear or read an explanation of that section.

This toolkit describes ways in which you can make your own narratives and tours of books, manuscripts, and artworks, using free IIIF tools like [Storiiies](broken-reference/) and [Exhibit](broken-reference/).
