# Padlet

[Padlet](https://en-gb.padlet.com/) is a free organisational tool that is extremely easy and intuitive to use. It has a range of applications for supporting exhibitions, from the early stages of collecting text, images, and links from multiple users (imagine a digital wall of post-it notes), right up to hosting the final product.

Many educational organisations will have an institutional subscription allowing unlimited use, but anyone can use the free version (neon package), which gives you access to three padlets.&#x20;
