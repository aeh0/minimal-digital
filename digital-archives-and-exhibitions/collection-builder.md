# CollectionBuilder

CollectionBuilder is one of a number of static site generators designed specifically for hosting digital exhibitions. It features a gentle learning curve that teaches the principles of good metadata management. Users create a GitHub account but no coding or command line knowledge is needed to set up or manage the project.

Developed by University of Idaho Library as a tool to create free digital collections, staff soon recognised its equal potential as a teaching tool. The focus is on metadata - all users need to do is gather a set of image files and prepare their associated metadata in a standardised, csv format. CollectionBuilder uses this metadata to conjure an exhibition website according to a pre-programmed template, which can be hosted and served using GitHub Pages.

All sites built using Collection Builder will look the same in terms of layout - the only difference is the image content and the functionality, which can scale according to need. A number of visualisation tools are available, as long as the metadata required to drive them is supported.&#x20;

If a user includes subject headings in their metadata, a tag cloud will generate. If dates are included, a timeline will appear. If latitude and longitude data is added, an interactive map will 'pin' the images to geographic locations. The final product gives the impression that a lot of programming has gone into the site, when in fact it is driven solely by csv.
