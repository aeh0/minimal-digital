# Google Sites

Google Sites] is the ideal tool to make a simple, free website with no adverts or branding, and requiring no coding knowledge.

The main advantage over other free website builders, such as Wordpress and Wix, is that Google Sites will not display adverts communicating political or commercial bias on your site, making it more suitable for neutral, scholarly publications. The example below is taken from a Wordpress blog post - the site owner is unable to control the nature, quantity or quality of the advertising shown without subscribing to a paid version.
