# Google Sites

[Google Sites](https://sites.google.com) is an ideal tool for making simple, free websites, with no adverts or branding, and requiring no coding knowledge.

The main advantage over other free website builders, such as Wordpress and Wix, is that Google Sites will not display adverts communicating political or commercial bias on your site, making it more suitable for neutral, scholarly publications. The example below is taken from a Wordpress blog post - a Wordpress site owner is unable to control the nature, quantity or quality of the advertising shown without upgrading to a paid subscription.

If you purchase a domain name for a small annual charge, Google Sites allows you to apply it to your site, e.g. http://\[website-title].com, but if you'd prefer to have no overheads, Google's free URLs are professional and reasonably short: https://sites.google.com/view/\[website-title]. Apart from 'google' featuring in the URL, no branding will appear on your site, and there's a free option to customise the header with an institutional logo, to comply with any local branding requirements.

Websites can be built from templates, or completely from scratch, without any need for coding knowledge. Click into the header and start typing to name your site. Then add components - text boxes, images, buttons, dividers, videos, image carousels, or pre-styled content bocks - by dragging and dropping onto the page. Components can be resized and rearranged by simply clicking and dragging. New pages can be added and nested - a menu navigation bar will be generated automatically. It doesn't take long to make a clean, professional looking site.

Appearance can be customised consistently, site-wide, by applying a theme, or at the level of the individual component. Clicking on a component will prompt which actions can be taken. A text box offers customisations for formatting - font style, size, colour, links, bullet points, indents, etc.

An image will offer options for cropping, adding links, captions and alt text. In short - if you're not sure how something works, try clicking on it. The interface is very intuitive, and all decisions are reversible. Undo and redo buttons at the top of the page can roll back or repeat actions. Changes are backed up in Google Drive, and sites can be published and unpublished to the web in one click.

You can generate a link to grant other users access to your site - to edit or to view it. Your site can be fully public, or only visible to users you have shared the link with.&#x20;
